# Chat Room




## ðŸŽ¯ Aim 
The project aims at facilitating instant messaging operation among the online users.
## ðŸ’¡ Abstract
Earlier there was no mode of online communication between users. In big or small organizations communication between users posed a challenge. There was a requirement to record these communications and store the data for further evaluation. The idea is to automate the existing Simple Chat Room system and make the users utilize the software so that their valuable information is stored digitally and can be retrieved for further management purposes.
